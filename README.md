An online implementation of the Set game. It is still under construction.

## Feature list

Here are some ideas we are considering to implement.

- A single-player mode, where you can try to get a high score.
- A multi-player mode across devices, where it's about who finds a set first. Getting the most sets wins you the game.
- A single-player mode where you play against a computer of roughly your own skill level.
- A beginner's mode, with only three properties per card.
- An advanced mode, with five properties per card.
- If you have any more ideas, drop a message.
